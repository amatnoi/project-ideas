## Project Idea: Data Science Platform (Sample Description) [Don't Edit]

This project will build a platform for exploring large datasets and applying pre-built machine learning algorithms to the data. The team will implement a Java Spring-based web platform for uploading, browsing, and formatting datasets. In addition, the team will implement a variety of machine learning algorithms / techniques that can be applied to the data. The machine learning modules will primarily be implemented in Python. 

The platform will focus on classification tasks. Users will be able to upload datasets in CSV or JSON and then select attributes of each data item to serve as labels. Once labeled datasets are available, users will be able to use graphical tools to draw a machine learning pipeline and choose algorithms to apply to the data without coding.

## Project Idea: Your Project Title Here [Don't Edit]


For my senior design project, I am going to build a multiplayer game where players will compete in a variety of mini-games in an effort to progress around a virtual game board. Players will be able to create persistent accounts and engage in synchronous online multiplayer games with one another, whether with randomly matched players, or with a local game hosted on a friend's device. This project is inspired by the success of multiplayer games such as quiplash, among us, and fallout guys. Games such as these have seen a huge uptick in popularity during COVID and have been a great source of entertainment for many of people - providing an outlet for social activity that doesn't have to break social distancing guidelines. 

This project will likely be written in react native in order to achieve cross platform compatibility for mobile devices, and will hopefully use a distributed game server to support concurrent multiplayer functionality. Having a wide array of potential minigames to develop will allow for our agile process to produce meaningful working content at each stage, while also allowing for enough potential creative leeway to keep pushing our development process forward with new content throughout the semester. We will have to use graphical tools to implement game sprites and such, and may have to implement basic physics engines for some of the minigames as well. As far as non-technical specs go, a significant chunk of time will probably be spent developing designs/ minigames that can be incorporated into the larger game.
